# Python_Workshop.Toy_Projects

This repository contains the solution of following problems.

1.  Tip Calculator:

Build a tip calculator app in Python. Logic being calculating a tip is as follows:
- if your bill is $ 43 and quality of service was 30% (satisfactory) and the waiter served 4
people, then tip amount will be: $3.23 by each person.
Formula: tip = (billed_amtount * service_quality) / num_of_people_served


2. Write a program that reads a CSV file and inserts each row into the database. Use SQLite or
MySQL.


3. Factorial Finder - The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and 
   the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.
   
4. Fibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.


5. Next Prime Number - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.
